A project I’ve been working on to practice some coding skills. (I’m not a data scientist, just a guy who likes emo.)
Overall, I had a sample size of 1,543 bands. I recorded bands per city, not releases per city. I used the webscraping tool ParseHub to obtain the data from Bandcamp (nothing fancy, basically just automating the process of clicking every band’s page) and Leaflet to create the map. I chose a black colour scheme because it’s more emo.
